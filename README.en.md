# ZhuaTech EV Charging Management

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for connected devices, edge operations, and multi-screen experiences.

ZhuaTech EV Charging Management provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for connected devices, edge operations, and multi-screen experiences. It is designed for device operators, field teams, service managers, and platform administrators, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.
